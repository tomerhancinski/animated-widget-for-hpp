One of the key features Home++ has is enabling developers to build animated widgets. This example shows how it's done on your side.

The [intents](http://hpp.intuitit.mobi/for-developers/animation-intents-list-1) Home++ used to get commands from your widget are exported to a jar, which could be downloaded [here](http://animated-widget-for-hpp.googlecode.com/files/hpp.jar).

1. Create a "libs" directory in your project

2. Put the jar in

3. Configure Java Build Path, and you're good to go
